  Single-cell RNA Velocity has dramatically advanced our ability to model cellular differentiation and cell fate decisions. However, current preprocessing choices and model assumptions often lead to errors in assigning developmental trajectories. Here, we develop, Pyro-Velocity, a Bayesian, generative, and multivariate RNA Velocity model to estimate the uncertainty of cell future states. This approach models raw sequencing counts with the synchronized cell time across all expressed genes to provide quantifiable and improved information on cell fate choices and developmental trajectory dynamics.

# Main text {#sec-main}

RNA Velocity is a powerful computational framework to estimate the time derivative of gene expression [@La_Manno2018-lj;@Svensson2018-vk;@Qiu2022-dj;@Bergen2020-pj]. The framework has been used to study developmental cell lineage trajectories over a broad spectrum of biological processes, such as  haematopoiesis [@Qiu2022-dj], pancreas development [@Bastidas-Ponce2019-lf], and neural progenitors differentiation [@Bergen2020-pj]. Yet, recent state-of-the-art RNA Velocity approaches such as velocyto and scVelo [@La_Manno2018-lj] have several limitations. First, they may predict developmental trajectories that do not exist in nature, as it has been shown in the analysis of fully mature blood cells [@Zheng2017-bz;@Bergen2021-qz]. Second, data preprocessing steps (e.g., selection of top variable genes, dimensionality reduction) affect velocity estimates that are difficult to characterize and might lead to artefactual predictions. In addition, non-linear spliced and unspliced imputation procedures could distort phase portrait geometry and recovered trajectories (Fig. 1a). Third, most RNA velocity algorithms perform estimates independently for each gene, and therefore cannot exploit the natural interdependence of gene expression. Fourth, a unified description of the temporal relation between cells can only be assigned based on postprocessing steps that aggregate heuristically the gene-wise fits into a shared latent time (Fig. 1a). Finally, current RNA velocity frameworks only output point estimates of the velocity vector field and do not provide uncertainty estimation. Importantly, the absence of statistical confidence estimates increases false discoveries as it leaves users without a way to evaluate the robustness of the methods’ outputs. To overcome these limitations, we developed a probabilistic generative model, named Pyro-Velocity, that estimates RNA dynamics and infers cell trajectories using Pyro8, a robust and efficient probabilistic programming language.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

The Introduction section, of referenced text [@greenwade93] expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable). The introduction should not include subheadings.

Springer Nature does not impose a strict layout as standard however authors are advised to check the individual requirements for the journal they are planning to submit to as there may be journal-level preferences. When preparing your text please also be aware that some stylistic choices are not supported in full text XML (publication version), including coloured font. These will not be replicated in the typeset article if it is accepted. 

# Using this template {#sec-template}

This Quarto template is unofficial and built out of Springer Nature's template. 
Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

As seen below, you can mix markdown and Latex with each other, though it's likely best to mostly use markdown.

## Cross Referencing

To reference a figure with example label "plot", use `@fig-plot`. 
Analogously, to reference a table with example label "data", use `@tbl-data`.
To reference a section, such as the Introduction (@sec-intro), use `@sec-intro`.

For complete information on cross referencing with Quarto, see <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html>.

## Citations

Quarto formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file. For a single citation use [@greenwade93]. For multiple citations use [@greenwade93;@knuth1984texbook]. If using an author-date-based citation style, then for a citation in parentheses use `[@greenwade93]` and for a text citation use `@greenwade93`. You can drop the author using `[-@greenwade93]`. If the tex output is to be included in a submission to a preprint server or publisher, the default citation method, `citeproc`, may not always produce bibliographies compatible with the provided `bst` styles. In this case, you can set `cite-method: natbib`. See <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html#sec-biblatex>. In this case, you may either restrict usage to the default bracketed key citation formats supported by pandoc, such as [@greenwade93] or [@greenwade93;@knuth1984texbook]. Or, use a CSL file, several of which are vendored in [_extensions/nature/csl](./_extensions/nature/csl/). The advantage of the latter is that references will be consistent across html, docx, and pdf outputs. See <https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citation-syntax> for additional details on pandoc citation styles.

![Pyro-Velocity is a fully generative Bayesian method with uncertainty estimation of velocity vector fields and shared latent time, based on raw counts and without ad-hoc preprocessing steps. a. Schematic comparing current RNA Velocity and Pyro-Velocity workflows. Both methods take in input spliced and unspliced read count tables and output RNA velocity vector fields and latent (shared) time. Previous methods require ad-hoc preprocessing steps, including the arbitrary selection of top variable genes, number of principal components, and kNN-pooling to impute both spliced and unspliced expression within the PCA-reduced spliced expression space. In addition, manually tuned ad-hoc postprocessing steps are used to compute the final vector field and latent time based on aggregation and smoothing of the independent velocity estimates for each gene which can dramatically change the velocity estimates. In contrast, Pyro-Velocity is a fully generative and probabilistic model that uses raw read counts. Our model requires minimal preprocessing and postprocessing steps and outputs a common shared time based on all the genes without additional aggregation steps. It also provides uncertainty estimation based on posterior samples. b. The main outputs of the Pyro-Velocity framework.

![Pyro-Velocity outperforms other RNA-velocity methods and accurately predicts cell lineage trajectories. a,b. RNA Velocity model comparisons from fully mature peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs, t-SNE embedded plots, a) or E15.5 mouse pancreas (UMAP embedded plots, b-c).  From left to right in panels a and b: 1. Cells colored by cell type; 2. Stream plot of velocity vector field defined by scVelo; 3. Stream plot of the posterior mean vector field from Pyro-Velocity; 4. Pyro-Velocity visualization of cell dynamics for 3 arbitrarily selected single cells; 5. Single-cell vector field uncertainty where each cell is colored based on the scaled angular standard deviation to visualize uncertainty based on n=30 iterated, posterior samples depicted as arrows noted throughout our analysis; 6. Averaged vector field uncertainty where each vector is colored by the averaged vector field uncertainty. The scaled angular standard deviation range is [0 360], where 0 corresponds to the highest confidence for a single direction, 360 corresponds to the highest uncertainty, and no directionality preference based on 30 posterior samples (4-6). Vectors were projected into the UMAP space using the scVelo API based on cosine similarity-derived transition matrix. c. UMAP embedded cells colored by the average cell shared time across 30 posterior samples. The Spearman’s correlation between Pyro-Velocity and Cytotrace is provided. d. Pyro-Velocity automatic gene selection and ranking for predicting important genes involved in pancreas development. e. Phase portraits of posterior samples average spliced and unspliced gene expression (left), rainbow plots showing denoised spliced gene expression (middle), and gene expression within UMAP embedded space.  Single dots correspond to individual cells (left, right) or vertical lines (middle). Cell type annotation coloring is the same as in panel b.](figures/fig.pdf){#fig-model-results}

![Graphical representations detail the generative process of the Pyro-Velocity models and highlight their differences. a. Pyro-Velocity Model 1. Each rectangle represents one data dimension (e.g., gene or cell). The arrows represent the directed hierarchical dependency among random variables. The white circles correspond to the modeled random variables. The probability distributions of these variables are denoted on the right legend. The gray circles correspond to intermediate results computed from random variables. In this model, the kinetics random variables for the cell shared time and gene are modeled with two constraints: 1. the shared time is strictly larger than the gene-specific activation time $t_{0}^{(0)}$, 2. the gene expression in the activate state starts with the initial condition $(u_{0}=0,\,s_{0}=0)$, as in previous methods[@La_Manno2018-lj;@Bergen2020-pj] (Methods). b. Pyro-Velocity Model 2. This figure follows the same graphical convention as in a. In this model $t_{0}^{(0)}$ is independent from the shared time, thus allowing a time lag for the gene activation phase. In addition, a positive starting basal gene expression level $(u_{0},\,s_{0})$ different than $(u_{0}=0,\,s_{0}=0)$ is allowed. (Methods). c. Schematic illustrating how the constraints proposed in Model 1 (left) and Model 2 (right) are reflected in the modeling of individual gene expression. The x-axis corresponds to the shared time, the y-axis corresponds to the posterior mean of the spliced expression level, the vertical lines with arrows show the start and end time of the observed cell sampling, t0 represents the gene-specific activation time $t_{0}^{(0)}$, the red lines highlight the differences for the potential gene-specific time lag when $t_{0}^{(0)} > {\min}\!⁡(t)$, and the initial spliced gene expression. The same differences can also be illustrated for the unspliced gene expression profiles (not shown).](figures/fig.pdf){#suppfig-graphical-models}
